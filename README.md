This is a RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) library based on [openzeppelin-solidity](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/ownership/rbac/RBAC.sol) but using bytes32 type for roles. We use this RBAC implementation, combined with a delegate proxy in [r8-app](https://github.com/runningbeta/r8-app) project.
